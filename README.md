# The NEW Dr. Sebi Nutritional Guide

A void was left in the soul of many people when Dr. Sebi ~was starved in prison~ passed away. After that, Dr. Sebi Cell Food and his dream of healing people were put on hold.

To fulfil that void, I created this.

A revivial of the Dr. Sebi Nutritional Guide, updated... every now and then. I intend to list as many natural food/herbs as possible and rule out hybrids all in a simple, easy-to-read manner. I'm no herbal healer myself but I have the Internet, books and my own trial-and-error at my disposal. If you trust that, you can trust this guide.

## The Guides

These images are taken directory from the latest master branch. They are, and always will be, the latest verion of the guide.

1. Install the .ttf files from /fonts to your computer.

I tried to organize the layers the best I can. 

## Methodology

Taken from [https://drsebiscellfood.com/methodology/](https://drsebiscellfood.com/methodology/)

"I am Dr. Sebi, founder of Dr. Sebi’s Research Institute. At this time, I would like to take this opportunity to give you a brief synopsis of how our premise and methodology achieves successful results in eradicating diseases.

This brief, but concise illustration will reveal our premise and methodology to be consistent. According to Western medical research, diseases are a result of the host being infected with a “germ”, “virus”, or “bacteria”. In their approach in treating these “infestations”, inorganic, carcinogenic chemicals are employed. Our research immediately uncovers flaws in their premise through basic deductive reasoning. By consistently utilizing the same premise and methods, they have consistently yielded ineffective results. In essence, in the 400-year tradition of the European philosophy of medicine, their approach in treating disease has yet to produce any cures.

In contrast, as we examine an African approach to disease, it diametrically opposes the present Western approach. Specifically, the African Bio-mineral Balance refutes the germ/virus/bacteria premise. Our research reveals that all manifestation of disease finds its genesis when and where the mucous membrane has been compromised. For example, if there is excess mucous in the bronchial tubes, the disease is Bronchitis; if it is in the lungs, the disease is Pneumonia; in the pancreatic duct, it is Diabetes; in the joints Arthritis. All of the African Bio-mineral Balance compounds are comprised of natural plants; which means its constitution is of an alkaline nature.

This is important- and instrumental in our success in reversing pathologies- because disease can only exist in an environment that is acid; thus it is inconsistent to utilize inorganic substances when treating disease because they are of an acid base. Only consistent use of natural botanical remedies will effectively cleanse and detoxify a diseased body, reversing it to its intended alkaline state.

Our system of nutrition goes even further. In addition to removing the accumulation of years of toxins, the African Bio-mineral Balance replaces depleted minerals and rejuvenates damaged cell tissue eroded by the acid, diseased state. The primary organs of elimination are the skin, liver, gall bladder, lymph glands, kidneys and the colon. If all toxins are eliminated from the above mentioned organs they will be recycled throughout the entire body, manifesting disease. Eventually the body breaks down in the weakest organs due to its inability to dispel the influence of toxins. The colon is the most important organ and must be cleansed by detoxifying before any disease can be reversed. If the colon is the only organ cleansed and detoxified the other major organs will be left toxic, thus leaving the disease in the body.

It is with Dr. Sebi’s intra-cellular detoxifying cleanse that each cell in the body will be purified. The body will then rebuild and rejuvenation will take place. Dr. Sebi offers the Bio-Mineral Therapy which is a natural vegetation cell food. A living substance which nourishes the body and detoxifies at the cellular level.

One must consume life – not Death – to maintain and sustain oneself."
